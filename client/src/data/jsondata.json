His interventions activate public spaces to encourage engagement, and often focus on ecological and social issues. His playful works suggest alternate possibilities for existing spaces, infrastructures, and materials found in urban environments. Frequently, he uses salvaged goods in unexpected ways that prompt conversation.\n\nAmong other notable projects, he was the lead artist on the Community Rising, the tallest mural in the world from 2013 to 2018 (now the second tallest), the result of a community project in St James Town, Toronto, with local youth, STEPS and the Toronto Muralists. Martindale has been the lead artist for a number of the GTAΓÇÖs largest mural projects. He continues to work closely with communities and organizations big and small; including partners such as Harbourfront Centre, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the City of Toronto.\n\nMartindale holds an MFA from the Interdisciplinary Masters of Art, Media and Design program at OCAD University in Toronto, and a BDes in Communication Design from Emily Carr University in Vancouver. He was the Decennial Hancock Lecturer at the University of TorontoΓÇÖs Hart House, where his presentation was broadcast by TVO for their Big Ideas series. He is a recipient of the prestigious Artist Prize from Toronto Friends of the Visual Arts, numerous grants at municipal, provincial, and federal levels, and a Chalmers Arts Fellowship from the Ontario Arts Council. Martindale was profiled for the first episode of CBCΓÇÖs Great Minds of Design, and his works have been featured digitally and published in traditional media around the world in multiple languages. His works have been exhibited publicly in many cities across the globe.\n\nRecently, Martindale was Harbourfront CentreΓÇÖs inaugural Visual Artist-in-Residence, and alongside his collaborator JP King, was also the first Artist-in-Residence with the City of Toronto, Solid Waste Management Services.\n\n-------------\n\nΓÇó\tWhile I continue to be interested in traditional mural forms, I am also excited to keep exploring other media/materials in the public realm, spearhead new practices, and explore diverse approaches to community engagement. As well, I am interested in potentially growing other areas of my practice, and taking on more roles in related areas such as project coordination, program development, and consulting.",

As well as painting community murals in playgrounds, on wading pools and in pedestrian laneways, she has recently enjoyed working with students to inspire them to approach large scale paintings in their own community and taking ownership and pride in who they are and in their neighborhoods.\nARTISTIC STATEMENT\nI have always been inspired by the newest STREET/PUBLIC artist projects around the world. When I start a project my sketches will often be uploaded and worked on digitally to see how my ideas respond to the space it will be painted on I can digitally mock up and idea and can easily share it with the client. Once at the wall producing the work, that amazing feeling of working in the public eye kicks in and the getting feedback from pedestrians is always an inspiration. Recently I have been using a combination of brushwork and aerosol painting techniques and I am thrilled with the vibrancy of color and effects produced. Finding the connection between the visual landscape and the images the community connects with is my biggest goal during my design process.",

I work exclusively with black and white images sing a combination of comic book illustration, graffiti street art and abstract images. Thematically my artworks explore the interrelationships between man, nature and technology primarily from an urban perspective. The goal of my work is express a positive optimistic warning towards progress and society. My work is playful yet insightful in order to appeal to audiences of all ages. I focus on live painting performances and street art because I believe public artworks have the most impact an offer the best opportunity to initiate dialogue. I worked as a fully licensed street artist from 2005-2009 where I created live murals at various locations across Toronto. Since that time I have become a full time muralist working across Canada and internationally. Notable clients include HudsonΓÇÖs Bay Co., Scotiabank, Converse, Dr. Martens, Waterloo University, UofT, Thyssenkrupp Canada, A.G.O. StreetARTToronto.",

        "artist_bio": "Visual Artist\n\nChristiano De Araujo is a self-taught artist who was born in An├ípolis, Goi├ís, Brazil. His earliest memory as a child is the moment when he discovered his love of art. As a toddler, he remembers picking up a crayon that his older sister had left behind. When she found that Christiano had taken it, she grabbed it away from him, but in that short amount of time, he had fallen in love with colours and the ability to create.\n\nHis love of art and his talent for the drawing were evident when he was a student in school. His first passion was comics and cartoons and at age 12 he drew his first comic strip.\n\nIn his late teens, Christiano began working for BrazilΓÇÖs highly circulated newspaper, Di├írio da Manh├ú, doing editorial cartoons and illustrations. He also continued to work for other local newspapers and magazines. Realizing that he wanted more opportunities than he could have in Brazil, Christiano chose to immigrate to Canada.\n\nHis first years in Canada were a struggle. Early on, he landed a job as a Bricklayer, which he did for a number of years. Christiano confronted his weaknesses and discovered his strengths, learned to laugh at his hardships, quickly moving on. He was able to overcome any adversities with a determination to succeed and a desire to make himself a better man. This led to his artwork being published in numerous magazines and newspapers in Toronto.\n\nHe also credits his success to a spiritual awakening that he had through meditation and self-hypnosis. It gave him clarity and focus. This experience gave him more confidence and the ability to control his emotions and himself. Christiano devotes much of his life to his art. His endeavours include drawing, oil and acrylic painting, airbrushing, cartooning and sculpting. He is an artist by trade, finds art fun and likes to explore new media and innovated techniques.\n\nChristiano currently resides in Toronto, Canada. He is the founder of Toronto Artists Studio, a studio of visual artists, painters, digital artists and sculptors who design and produce murals and visual communication projects for audiences on a small and grand scale.\n\nAt the present moment, this very momentΓÇª Christiano is enjoying the wonderful interaction between the mind and the universe. This infinite universe in which we are all one!",

        "artist_bio": "Amir Akbari is a Greater Toronto Area (GTA) based Visual Artist, Educator, Community Advocate and Entrepreneur.   In 2002, he enrolled in OCAD University where he would go on to complete a Bachelors of Fine Arts with a focus on Drawing and Painting.  In 2003, Amir led his first community mural art project working with Urban Art Toronto.  The following year, he took on his first role with Street Art (then Graffiti Transformation Project) as the lead artist with Lamp Community Health Centre.  That project would be a launching pad for his eventual artistic and professional career.From 2003 to 2010 Amir continued to work with various community organizations and charities as an artist facilitator, youth works and educator.  He would go onto complete over 30 public murals throughout this time, working with and mentoring hundreds of youth across the GTA.In 2010 Amir founded Behind the Line with the purpose of providing existing support structures within the community with creative and artistic support.  Behind the Line has since worked closely with multiple organizations to enhance their arts programming and creative reach, from curriculum development, programming consultation and arts integration strategies.In the summer of 2019, Amir completed his largest mural production, the Susan Street Mural at 3847 Lawrence Ave. East.  This would be his 6th Street Art Partnership Project with the Boys & Girls Club of East Scarborough and his 3rd partnership with Toronto Community Housing.  The large 14 story mural is the crowning achievement of his artistic journey as a community and mural artist.  Focused on creating designs that reflect, represent and inspire the communities that he is working with, this mural is a celebration of the collaborative and uplifting nature of public murals funded by Street Art Toronto.His work is rooted in the belief that self-expression can have a lasting impact on the development and growth of young people and their communities, and that there is a disproportional disadvantage across the board for those that face multiple barriers with accessing the arts.   He hopes to fill this void through innovative arts strategies, collaborative mural projects and local community partnerships.",

        "artist_bio": "Sean Martindale is an internationally recognized, award winning interdisciplinary artist and designer based in Toronto, Canada. His interventions activate public spaces to encourage engagement, and often focus on ecological and social issues. His playful works suggest alternate possibilities for existing spaces, infrastructures, and materials found in urban environments. Frequently, he uses salvaged goods in unexpected ways that prompt conversation.\n\nAmong other notable projects, he was the lead artist on the Community Rising, the tallest mural in the world from 2013 to 2018 (now the second tallest), the result of a community project in St James Town, Toronto, with local youth, STEPS and the Toronto Muralists. Martindale has been the lead artist for a number of the GTAΓÇÖs largest mural projects. He continues to work closely with communities and organizations big and small; including partners such as Harbourfront Centre, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the City of Toronto.\n\nMartindale holds an MFA from the Interdisciplinary Masters of Art, Media and Design program at OCAD University in Toronto, and a BDes in Communication Design from Emily Carr University in Vancouver. He was the Decennial Hancock Lecturer at the University of TorontoΓÇÖs Hart House, where his presentation was broadcast by TVO for their Big Ideas series. He is a recipient of the prestigious Artist Prize from Toronto Friends of the Visual Arts, numerous grants at municipal, provincial, and federal levels, and a Chalmers Arts Fellowship from the Ontario Arts Council. Martindale was profiled for the first episode of CBCΓÇÖs Great Minds of Design, and his works have been featured digitally and published in traditional media around the world in multiple languages. His works have been exhibited publicly in many cities across the globe.\n\nRecently, Martindale was Harbourfront CentreΓÇÖs inaugural Visual Artist-in-Residence, and alongside his collaborator JP King, was also the first Artist-in-Residence with the City of Toronto, Solid Waste Management Services.\n\n-------------\n\nΓÇó\tWhile I continue to be interested in traditional mural forms, I am also excited to keep exploring other media/materials in the public realm, spearhead new practices, and explore diverse approaches to community engagement. As well, I am interested in potentially growing other areas of my practice, and taking on more roles in related areas such as project coordination, program development, and consulting.",

With his continued artistic development, illustration became his\ndeepest passion and talent. His desire to learn and absorb from his surroundings led him on a\npersonal creative journey. As a graduate of the Graphic Design program at Humber College\nwith over 10 years of working experience behind him, Adrian has established his place in\nTorontoΓÇÖs modern art community. His style is provocative and inspiring and defies\ncategorization. Blurring the lines between graffiti and ultra realism, AdrianΓÇÖs voice and vision is\ninstantly identifiable. His works include countless portraits and illustrations for various\nmagazines and collaborations with the City of Toronto to develop murals for vacant community\nspaces. In the past Adrian has painted complete buildings and city blocks, designed award\nwinning video games and animated television shows. He has also successfully developed and\nfiled a functioning patent for the Stud Horse Foldable Drawing Bench and is the Principal and\nFounder of Behind the Front Visual Arts Studio.",

I believe in the values of the StART programs and have experienced the dedication of the team to carrying out these values through supporting and partnering.\n\nI am a visual artist passionate about arts engagement and education, collaborative art making, and murals. These practices bridge my background from a Bachelor of Fine Art in Drawing & Painting from OCAD University and a Community Arts Practice Certificate from York University. Since 2011, I have worn many ΓÇÿhatsΓÇÖ in the mural, art and community arts field; from artist, arts educator, facilitator, curator, arts administrator and project manager. I have had the opportunity to work and learn from these experiences, building adaptability and flexibility through working in unique situations including libraries, schools, art galleries, community centres, seniors centres, skate parks, abandoned storefronts (you name it!). I have built a strong rapport working with many artists and arts organizations such as Mural Routes, Vibe Arts, Nuit Blanche, Lakeshore Arts, Platform A, Scribble me Silly, Arts Etobicoke and East End Arts. In particular, I have worked closely with Mural Routes since 2011, as Program Coordinator, Facilitator, Curriculum Coordinator, and Program Director, with a focus on mentorship and the Mural Art Learning Institute programs.\n\nMy creative processes for involving community and youth in projects within their own neighbourhoods are based in facilitation style that creatively employs storytelling, brainstorming, and playful art techniques like collage to encourage conversations, confidence and to bring many ideas together into action. It gives me great joy to facilitate consultation, design, art making and mural making to bring community members together to reflect and re-imagine their neighbourhood. I love any opportunity to nurture participantsΓÇÖ creative abilities and create a safe space for exploration and connection through visual arts and storytelling. I see art as a tool for exploring themes, beginning conversation, gathering patterns and beginning important dialogue. Mural consultation and participation offers a space where artists and community members alike can share, exchange, grow and work together.",

As well as painting community murals in playgrounds, on wading pools and in pedestrian laneways, she has recently enjoyed working with students to inspire them to approach large scale paintings in their own community and taking ownership and pride in who they are and in their neighborhoods.\nARTISTIC STATEMENT\nI have always been inspired by the newest STREET/PUBLIC artist projects around the world. When I start a project my sketches will often be uploaded and worked on digitally to see how my ideas respond to the space it will be painted on I can digitally mock up and idea and can easily share it with the client. Once at the wall producing the work, that amazing feeling of working in the public eye kicks in and the getting feedback from pedestrians is always an inspiration. Recently I have been using a combination of brushwork and aerosol painting techniques and I am thrilled with the vibrancy of color and effects produced. Finding the connection between the visual landscape and the images the community connects with is my biggest goal during my design process.",

StART has helped me create meaningful work that strengthens communities and enables me to develop my practice of using art as a way to build inclusive communities who celebrate their identity with pride. I would like to develop my leadership skills and am interested in mentorship opportunities where I can learn how to work more effectively with the city to realize large scale initiatives that give more artists and community members opportunities to feel empowered through the process of creating art in the public realm.\n\nI am a Toronto based visual artist, community organizer, muralist, curator, and eternal optimist. My work is motivated by my desire to spread joy, nurture present minded living, cultivate gratitude, and foster new social interactions from a place of love and empathy. Using aerosol and acrylic paint, I work with bright colours and bold patterns to captivate peopleΓÇÖs attention and fill them with delight and hope. I am passionate about creating art that both aesthetically and psychologically brightens the streets and work to build a community around positive living.\n\nMy belief that public art is a powerful tool for building community drives my practice. In 2017, I founded Womxn Paint, an annual street art jam that has produced 44 murals celebrating the strength and diversity of womxn. I would like to continue this initiative and grow it to include additional programming that supports the professional development of womxn artists and more opportunities for young girls to learn about mural arts. In 2016, I facilitated an intergenerational mural at Baycrest Health Sciences and would like work more with the senior community.\n\nOver the last six years, I have created custom large-scale outdoor artworks for clients including The New Yorker, Tourism Canada, the City of Toronto, the City of Mississauga, the Consulate General of the Federal Republic of Germany in Toronto, the STEPS Initiative, Arts Etobicoke, East End Arts and private clients.",

With over a decade of experience producing projects for exhibition and clients, my multi-disciplinary techniques are versatile, but also maintain a recognizable style. Inspired by illustration, graffiti, and comic books, my work is known for its emphasis on line and texture, and its exploration of form using interpretive contour lines. Paintings are constructed by merging pop art aesthetics with contemporary urban art materials and techniques.\n\nMy work explores themes that revel in a flippant joie de vivre, yet remain lightly steeped in some measure of memento mori. The combined effect is one of playfully self-assured yet shadowed cheek. My compositions tend to centre on a central figure, giving the piece a definitive focal point from which the viewer can explore. The subjects of my work are chosen for their relevance to the project or location, or simply for their relevance to me. Visual impact in my murals is further accomplished through a vibrant and textured usage of colour. In these paintings, colour is freed from its formal descriptive function and displays energy and motion through a build up of spray and acrylic paint layers.\n\nI want to continue working with StART as I have been creating projects with their team since year one, and I greatly appreciate the opportunities that theyΓÇÖve funded and helped bring to fruition for both my peers and myself.  I am hoping to grow the scale of my work in the public realm, while simultaneously gaining the key skills necessary in developing the business side of my career. With the backing of StART I have painted 14 traffic signal boxes, participated in roughly 10 StART funded mural jams, assisted American artist Andrew Schoultz in 2012 on one of the first Partnership Program murals, and most recently assisted BirdO on the first Monumental Program wall.",

In each case, MEDIAH has proved that he can stay on schedule and within budget. He was also invited and commissioned by a Nuit Blanche curator to create a large-scale vinyl wrap installation for the 2018 Nuit BlancheΓÇÖs exhibition in Scarborough Town CentreΓÇÖs subway station and worked cooperatively with all involved. This 2018 Nuit Blanche installation was a huge success. Abroad, MEDIAH has been commissioned to paint large scale art murals all over the world in locations such as; Barbados, Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Germany, South Africa, and throughout the United States of America and Canada.\n\nWith 25 years of experience, MEDIAH has become a staple and is considered a pioneer of the Canadian street art movement. ┬¡An internationally renowned visual artist, MEDIAH is a trendsetter sparking new ideas and originality by blurring the lines between post-graffiti and dynamic abstraction. BlakeΓÇÖs work consists of weaving traditional street art forms with traditional painterly techniques. Heavily inspired by avionics, mechanical engineering, and schematics, the artwork glorifies and captures the essence of speed, motion, dynamism, and force to create movement on the image surface.\n\nAs an artist, MEDIAH strives to create visual content that inspires, intrigues and uplifts his audience. BlakeΓÇÖs past work has very rarely been vandalized or damaged due to his pedigree as an international visual artist. He has been described as ΓÇÿone of the most respected and revered graffiti artists in CanadaΓÇÖ by both vandals and street artists due to his extensive and prolific career painting large-scale murals, participating in solo and group art exhibitions, and creating immersive, cinematic video and animation productions.\n\nHis formal education in broadcast design, motion graphics, VFX and video post-production, combined with his past work experience (Fox soccer, Rogers Sportsnet, Rubberpixel, and Sinking Ship Entertainment) are pivotal to his production and project planning. MEDIAH is formally trained in Digital media and Visual Effects, allowing him to be able to document large-scale projects with cinema and broadcast quality video, graphics, and photography to create a polished package.",
